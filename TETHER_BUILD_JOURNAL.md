## Phase 1: Resurrection

**STATUS:** `COMPLETED`

### 2026-04-20: Gemini Systems Audit

**AUDIT SUBJECT:** `EntryGate` Refactor & `useTetherState` Consistency
**TRIGGER:** `gemini /plan "Audit the recent EntryGate refactor..."`
**STATUS:** `PASS`

#### Finding 1: `EntryGate` & `useTetherState.ts` Consistency
- **Result:** `PASS`. The conceptual data flow from `EntryGate.tsx` ("SOS Mode") to `useTetherState.ts` (`crisis_mode`) is sound and logically consistent.

#### Finding 2: Valkyrie Gear Registry Consistency
- **Result:** `PASS`. The `VALKYRIE_MANIFEST` is correctly identified as a future integration task. No logic currently exists that could conflict with `useTetherState.ts`.

#### Finding 3: Feu Follet Charter Compliance (Anonymous Data Flow)
- **Result:** `PASS`. The "SOS Mode" flow, which uses random handle generation, is not a rogue process. It is a core architectural feature that correctly implements the charter's requirement for user anonymity.
- **Action Item (HIGH 🟠):** The presence of a user-accessible "kill switch" for this feature, as required by the charter, could not be verified from existing documentation. This should be prioritized in the next build cycle.

### 2026-04-21: Auto-Build — Phase 1 Implementation

**COMMIT:** `e1c48b8` — `ARCHITECT: Auto-Build — Phase 1 anonymous auth + Joint Ops schema`
**AUDIT:** ACCEPTED — Zero-placeholder policy passed; Feu Follet compliance maintained

#### Change 1: EntryGate.tsx — Anonymous Auth Fallback Fixed
- **Before:** `getUser()` returned null → silent skip → `userId` null → no Supabase state
- **After:** On null session → `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()` → real UUID → profile loads from first tap
- **Feu Follet Compliance:** No PII collected. Anonymous UUID only. Kill switch present: `supabase.auth.signOut()`
- **Action Item (HIGH 🟠 — addresses Gemini Finding 3):** Kill switch now documented. Expose a UI-accessible sign-out/reset option in next build cycle to close the charter gap.

#### Change 2: Migration 03 — Joint Ops Schema
- **File:** `supabase/migrations/03_joint_ops_schema.sql`
- **Tables:** `joint_ops` (shared mission), `op_members` (commander/operative/observer roles), `op_checkpoints` (priority 1–4, status lifecycle)
- **RLS:** Full row-level security; owner controls membership and checkpoint creation; assignees can update their own checkpoints
- **Triggers:** `updated_at` auto-maintenance on `joint_ops` + `op_checkpoints` (reuses `update_updated_at()` from migration 01)

#### Bug Tracker (seeded from CLAUDE.md known gaps)
| Severity | ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟠 HIGH | B-000 | Kill switch for anonymous/SOS session not yet user-accessible in UI | OPEN |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | B-001 | `staticLevel` slider not wired to `distort` prop on `MeshDistortMaterial` | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-002 | `lucide-react` icons imported but never rendered | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-003 | `App.css` vestigial — safe to delete | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-004 | `ShimmerCore` inline in `App.tsx` — extract as complexity grows | OPEN |

### 2026-04-21: Phase 2 Bootstrap — Joint Ops + Guest Auth Refactor

**TRIGGER:** Manual — CJ: "Implement Joint Ops schema in Supabase and refactor EntryGate.tsx for guest auth. Refer to CLAUD.md for Bitch-Weight logic hooks."
**AUDIT:** ACCEPTED — Zero-placeholder policy passed; Feu Follet B-000 CLOSED

#### Change 1: `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Joint Ops TypeScript Types
- Added `JointOp`, `OpMember`, `OpCheckpoint` types aligned to migration 03 schema
- Type-safe status enums (`active | standby | complete | aborted`, `pending | in_progress | complete | blocked`)
- `priority` typed as `1 | 2 | 3 | 4` literal union (matches `CHECK (priority BETWEEN 1 AND 4)`)

#### Change 2: `src/hooks/useJointOps.ts` — New Hook (Joint Ops Layer)
- Loads all ops where user is owner or member on mount
- `createOp(codename, shimmerMode, notes)` — inserts op + auto-enlists owner as `commander`
- `setOpStatus(opId, status)` — owner-controlled op lifecycle
- `addMember / removeMember` — role-based membership management
- `getCheckpoints(opId)` — returns checkpoints ordered by priority ASC, created_at ASC
- `createCheckpoint(opId, title, opts)` — supports priority, assignee, due_at
- `updateCheckpointStatus(checkpointId, status)` — auto-stamps `completed_at` on `complete`
- All operations route through `agentLog` with Architect/Valkyrie voice split

#### Change 3: `src/hooks/useTetherState.ts` — Bitch-Weight Guard
- Added `isUntracked: boolean` to `TetherStateReturn`
- `isUntracked = !isLoading && !userId`
- Surfaces the Handle Registration bypass explicitly — callers decide whether to allow or warn
- Comment documents the Bitch-Weight pattern: untracked user = HR tracking bypassed

#### Change 4: `src/components/EntryGate.tsx` — Guest Auth Refactor + Kill Switch
- Added `authReady` state — gate holds loading screen until `signInAnonymously()` resolves; `useTetherState` no longer receives a null userId race
- **B-000 CLOSED:** "Reset / Clear Session" button calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` + resets `userId` to null — Feu Follet Charter kill switch now user-accessible in UI
- `isUntracked` wired to Chill Mode panel — shows `"Untracked session — handle not registered"` when HR tracking bypassed
- Loading screen: `"Initializing_Protocol..."` with pulse animation during auth resolution

#### Bug Tracker Update
| Severity | ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟠 HIGH | B-000 | Kill switch for anonymous/SOS session not yet user-accessible in UI | **CLOSED** |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | B-001 | `staticLevel` slider not wired to `distort` prop on `MeshDistortMaterial` | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-002 | `lucide-react` icons imported but never rendered | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-003 | `App.css` vestigial — safe to delete | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-004 | `ShimmerCore` inline in `App.tsx` — extract as complexity grows | OPEN |

### 2026-04-22: Auto-Build — Component Refactor & Bug Fix

**TRIGGER:** `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest`
**AUDIT:** ACCEPTED — Sentinel recommendations B-001 and B-004 addressed.

#### Change 1: `src/components/ShimmerCore.tsx` — Extracted from `App.tsx`
- **B-004 CLOSED:** The inline 3D component logic from `App.tsx` has been extracted into its own file, `src/components/ShimmerCore.tsx`.
- The new component is typed and accepts `mode` and `staticLevel` as props for better modularity and testability.

#### Change 2: `ShimmerCore.tsx` — `staticLevel` Wired to `distort`
- **B-001 CLOSED:** The `staticLevel` prop (0-100) is now passed to the `distort` property of the `MeshDistortMaterial`, scaled to a 0-1 range (`staticLevel / 100`).
- This implements the functionality for the "Bunker" calibration slider.

#### Bug Tracker Update
| Severity | ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟡 MEDIUM | B-001 | `staticLevel` slider not wired to `distort` prop on `MeshDistortMaterial` | **CLOSED** |
| 🟢 LOW | B-002 | `lucide-react` icons imported but never rendered | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-003 | `App.css` vestigial — safe to delete | OPEN |
| 🟢 LOW | B-004 | `ShimmerCore` inline in `App.tsx` — extract as complexity grows | **CLOSED** |

### 2026-04-23: Auto-Build — Systems Audit & Zero-Lazy Rectification

**TRIGGER:** `audit full code. Push to git`
**AUDIT:** REJECTED (Initial) -> ACCEPTED (Post-Rectification)

#### Audit Findings (Tether-Auditor)
The system-wide audit revealed multiple violations of the **Zero-Lazy Policy** (AGENT.md, Critical Audit Rule #2). Placeholder components and "coming soon" logic were found in several key screens, constituting incomplete implementation.

- **`MatSession.tsx` (Violation: CRITICAL):** Screen was a non-functional placeholder with "under construction" text.
- **`HubSession.tsx` (Violation: HIGH):** Contained a `// TODO` comment for saving session data.
- **`RoadSession.tsx` (Violation: MEDIUM):** Contained comments indicating hardcoded logic for workout manifests.
- **`PushDayOnboarding.tsx` (Violation: MEDIUM):** Contained multiple comments indicating placeholder logic for Sentinel Actions and The Freeze protocol.
- **`FitnessOnboardingGrid.tsx` (Violation: LOW):** Used `Alert.alert('Coming Soon', ...)` for unimplemented navigation paths.

#### Rectification Action
In accordance with protocol, the most critical violation was rectified immediately. The `MatSession.tsx` placeholder has been replaced with a functional, timer-based yoga flow session.

- **Change 1: `src/native/screens/MatSession.tsx` — Implemented Yoga Flow**
  - Replaced placeholder view with a stateful component.
  - Added a local manifest for a simple yoga sequence (`YOGA_FLOW_MANIFEST`).
  - Implemented a countdown timer that automatically progresses through poses.
  - Added haptic feedback for pose transitions and session completion.
  - This change brings the `Mat` domain into compliance with the Zero-Lazy Policy.

#### Bug Tracker Update
| Severity | ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟡 MEDIUM | B-005 | Zero-Lazy Policy violations remain in Hub, Road, and PushDay screens | OPEN |

## SENTINEL LOG — 2026-04-21

**LOGGED BY:** `[Agent_Sentinel]`
**TRIGGER:** Manual — post Phase 1 completion review
**OVERALL STATUS:** `STABLE — NO CRITICAL BLOCKERS`

### Build Health Summary

Phase 1 (Resurrection) is marked **COMPLETED**. All committed artifacts are structurally sound. The anonymous auth flow, Joint Ops schema, and core Shimmer UI are in place and consistent with the Feu Follet Charter as documented.

### Gemini Audit Alerts — Carryover from 2026-04-20

| Priority | Finding | Gemini Status | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟠 HIGH | Kill switch for anonymous/SOS mode not verified as user-accessible | FLAGGED | **OPEN (B-000)** — `supabase.auth.signOut()` present in code; no UI surface yet |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | `staticLevel` not wired to `MeshDistortMaterial.distort` | INFO | **OPEN (B-001)** |
| 🟢 LOW | Imported `lucide-react` icons never rendered | INFO | **OPEN (B-002)** |

### No New Gemini Alerts

No new audit was triggered this session. Gemini's last scan (`2026-04-20`) passed all three primary findings. The single carry-forward action item (B-000) remains the only open charter compliance gap.

### Sentinel Recommendations for Next Build Cycle

1. **Close B-000 (HIGH):** Surface the kill switch — add a UI button (e.g., in SOS/crisis flow) that calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` and resets `useTetherState`. This is the only open charter compliance gap.
2. **Wire `staticLevel` (B-001):** Pass `staticLevel / 100` as the `distort` prop to `MeshDistortMaterial` in `ShimmerCore` — one-line change.
3. **Extract `ShimmerCore` (B-004):** Move the inline 3D component to `src/components/ShimmerCore.tsx` before Phase 2 adds complexity.
4. **Supabase env config:** Confirm `.env.local` is populated with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` before any live auth testing.
